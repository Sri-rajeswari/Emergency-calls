# Emergency-calls
   Here in this code, I have tried to empower the usage of the datas that are available to us.We often seek to transform the way the city works through the usage of data. I believe that by using the data and its evidences,we can improve our operations and the evidences we provide. 
   Here by using a python code, I have implemented a data analysis from the "emergency calls" dataset obtained from KAGGLE.
   This can widely be useful for Health Ministry Department, Fire Department Call,ect.
